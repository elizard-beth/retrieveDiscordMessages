# retrieveDiscordMessages
Using your requested data from discord, use this to convert it to JSON.

This requires `csv-string`, which you can install using `npm i csv-string`.

Instructions:
1. Place `index.js` in a folder directly outside of the `messages` folder.
2. Create a json file called `information.json` in the same directory as `index.js`
3. Run `index.js`
4. `information.json` should now have all of your messages!
